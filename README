NGINX config file path : /usr/local/etc/nginx

First steps
1. Parsing the required data for the CGI routes into the config file.
2. Identifying which request is a CGI request and routing it to the wrapper function.
3. Ensuring that the wrapper function is able to handle the request and return the response.
4. POST and GET routes to upload images
5. Are we doing separate output formatting?

1. --> Can provide direct path to the executable, no need for roundabout execution.
2. --> Inside the first request you get, you read until the `Content-Length` is satisfied
3. --> Using the `nc localhost 9999` command, you can send a request in broken pieces
And the user should be able to handle it until it is sorted out
4. `Transfer-encoding` is used to identify a chunked request.
	You have to go through the entire chunked request (Or the whole size of the data)
5. `Multi-part form/data` is used to send images over in our request
Figure out syntax for multipart handling... Or use content-length maybe
