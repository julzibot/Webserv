NGINX config file path : /usr/local/etc/nginx

First steps
1. Parsing the required data for the CGI routes into the config file.
2. Identifying which request is a CGI request and routing it to the wrapper function.
3. Ensuring that the wrapper function is able to handle the request and return the response.
4. POST and GET routes to upload images
5. Are we doing separate output formatting?

1. --> Can provide direct path to the executable, no need for roundabout execution.
2. --> Inside the first request you get, you read until the `Content-Length` is satisfied
3. --> Using the `nc localhost 9999` command, you can send a request in broken pieces
And the user should be able to handle it until it is sorted out
4. `Transfer-encoding` is used to identify a chunked request.
	You have to go through the entire chunked request (Or the whole size of the data)
5. `Multi-part form/data` is used to send images over in our request
Figure out syntax for multipart handling... Or use content-length maybe
Tests to run:

0. Arguments test, bad .config file

1. Basic GET, POST, DELETE 
  a. Incorrect route/location/youpi
  b. Incorrect method
2. Autoindexing
3. Redirection
4. Accessing a file inside a certain route
5. Error pages
  * 404
  * 405 - method not implemented
  * 408
6. Multiple port access (testing throughout all open ports)
7. Multiserver-level access (testing same port multiple server access)
8. Connection timeout

To fix ASAP:
  1. Allow only authorised METHODS
  2. Redirect does not work with neither the Postman or the browser, find out why
  3. How to test 405?
  4. What if someone sends invalid method in a request:
    How will output be sent to it? ReceiveFromExistingClient needs updating, (_recvsize > 0)
